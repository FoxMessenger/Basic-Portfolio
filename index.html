    	<h2>About Me</h2>

    	<img id="bio-image" src="images/liam-photo.jpg" alt="Your Name">

    	<p>Liam Fox is a designer and avid geek with the ability to look totally legit—though we are concerned it's all in his head; he's a complete fool, with a whole heart, and a tendency to know about topics regarding subjects in which he has little information—but really he just forgets what it was he learned. </p>

		<!-- 		<p>He enjoys conversing about subjects regarding the future, design, memes and life, and rarely of politics and religion, but always up to play devil's advocate if his vernacular doesn't fail him. He's been designing and arguing for over 10 years now; having theoretically lost at least 60% of all verbal battles, he still believes he's won each one with passive aggression. And when all is lost he puts that energy into his art. </p>

		<p>Having studied design in Secondary and University, he believes he has a strong understanding of typography, weight, placement, and creativity. Whether he does or not is always up to the client ... 's cousin/son/artsy friend.</p>

		<p>Always trying new things to get out of the feeling of already having tried something, Liam enjoys the idea of being a Jack of All Trades—and a student of all Masters.<p>

		<p>"Learning has always been enjoyable, and though not always accomplished quickly, nor easily, it feels great to see the product of your ventures"</p>

		<p>Is a quote that was totally not made up now, but spoken from the very lips of Liam as he was typing these words to make sure that it sounded legit.</p> -->
